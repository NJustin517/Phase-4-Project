The Elden Store is a template for a store front.  With the growing number of smaller businesses and content creators, we wanted to build a site that could allow those types of clients to sell various items related to their brands.  This demo site is themed after the popular videogame Elden Ring.

## Installation/Use

`bundle install` will install the backend (Ruby on Rails) dependencies, and running `npm install --prefix client` will install the React frontend dependencies.

After that, simply run `rails s` to start the backend server, and `npm start --prefix client` to run the frontend in development mode in your browser.
